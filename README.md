# ROV-PCB-
Design Rov Pcb boards including power and communication boards  
THE README ubove include design of Rov system , also some of them are modules which designed in schamtic and pcb with 3D footprint if i could find during my-work ,

specifically the file iclude design of :
1) ROV test board >> include all system so i can easily check the system easily with one compatible board before the design of separated boards .
2) Station board  >> it's the first board and is an outer board from the stucture so we can easily control the geibbers with pneumatic controlled by actuators
3) cytron         >> it's a footprint of cytron which is 2-channel motor driver .
4) current sensor >> used as protection to control the limitation of current .
5)    imu         >> module to get angles and modify it's motion to be flat degree .
6)  canbus        >> to tranmitt data beteen micro-controllers .
7)  relay 5v      >> was my first design and is an automatic control circuit and to control a high-current using a low-current signal. 
8)  H-bridge      >> is used to drive a load, such as a brushed DC motor, in both directions.  

each design include (.schDoc) , (.pcbDoc) ,(.prj)  
some of them with 3-model as a plus but all have footprint and design .
